## PortfolioV2
The second iteration of my portfolio. I created my original one right after I learned how to create traditional MVC websites, so I figured it was a good time to show off my react skills and make a new one from scratch with better performance and more features

This website is built using the following technologies:
 - NextJS
 - Tailwind CSS
 - Google Sheets + Google Drive for content storage
 - Deployed on Vercel

This was a huge help getting Google Sheets to work, all credit goes to the author: https://blog.openreplay.com/build-a-blog-with-google-sheets-as-a-headless-cms/
