My first developer portfolio was created after I completed my Udemy webdev bootcamp, the purpose of which was to demonstrate my knowledge of webdev fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Routing, Templating, etc...

One interesting problem was how to store data. I wanted a website that could be continually updated over time, so hard coding every page seemed like a bad idea. I eventually settled on hard coding my data into a JSON file and looping over the data when I wanted to present it.

This caused issues of its own however, such as the entire project needing to be redeployed every time I wanted to add a project. A better solution would have been to use a CMS, but I had no idea what those were at the time.
