This project was originally created by following the listed tutorials:

After completing the tutorial, I felt as though the project had more potential and decided to use it as the starting point for my own application. This involved an entire overhaul of the frontend, where I used overlays to display the content instead of having everything on screen at the same time.

In hindsight, this was a terrible idea since the overlay component I created was too large and covered up too much of the screen and resulted in spacing issues where for example, a tiny form was inside a massive overlay. In the future, I would either use a smaller overlay or a set up a routing system and have the forms/posts show up in a new webpage.

In addition, I updated the tech stack to use cloud based services, such as hosting my images on Cloudinary and using MongoDB Atlas for my database.

On reviewing the application after a couple months away, I noticed a number of amaterish oversights, such as the tab name still being called "React App".

I've come to realize these minor details are what separate production applications from amateur projects such as this one and that I still have a long way to go on the path of mastery. In the future, I intend to create an updated version of the website that fixes most of the issues while updating the tech stack away from Create-React-App.
