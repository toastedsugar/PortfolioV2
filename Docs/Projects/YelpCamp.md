This project was the final project for Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.

This project's purpose was to put everything taught through the course of the Bootcamp into use into creating a full production application. This application was created using the traditional MVC structure using an Express server to render pages before sending them back the the client. In addition, the server also handled user authentication. The data is stored on MongoDB Cloud and images are stored on Cloudinary.

The frontend was built using HTML, CSS via Bootstrap and Javascript. In addition, it features a number of features such as client side validation and user interactive forms.
