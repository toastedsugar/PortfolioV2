A blog dedicated to spreading the truth about raccoon related conspiracies

I created this blog by vaguely following a tutorial, mostly to understand how some of the granular features of NextJS worked, GraphQL basics, and how/what a CMS is and how I can build applications around one. 

This applications tech stack consists of the following technologies:
 - NextJS
 - Tailwind
 - Hygraph (Content Management)
 - GraphQL
 - Vercel for deployment

I wrote a custom react hook and templated my CSS to create a night mode/light mode toggle. I decided to be a bit more bold with my colors and ended up going with a purple color scheme.

The website is designed to be mobile first to provide a modern browsing experience to the average reader, who is likely visiting the site on their mobile phone. The shift to working on the mobile version before anything else was a bit rough to transition to, as I had spent most of my time up to then focusing on desktop interfaces. However, it makes much more sense to focus on the mobile version, since that is where most traffic comes from.

I also added a form to submit comments. This sumbits the comment to the CMS to be reviewed by the website administrator before it is allowed to appear in the comment section.
