My journey with web development began with this project. 

While taking Python courses at my local Community College, I learned how to scrape webpages and store/analyze data to get desired results. I decided to use that knowledge to create a small application to scrape Craigslist for cars of a specific make, model, price and mileage. This eventually got me interested in how web pages were structured and learning how to make my own.

A major flaw looking back would be how the application is structured. The entire scraper is a single Python function, making the code difficult to read. If I were to do this again, I would probably take advantage of Python's object oriented features to break the code down in to easily readable chunks.
